# data-structures
Coding up all the common data structures. Here are the ones I've completed or are currently working on:
- Linked list
- Stack
- Trees
- Hash table
- Graphs
- Linked hash map

Each data structure folder (in the src folder) contains an API file (as a Java interface) and a Java class that implements the respective interface. Tests for each data structure are in the Tests folder.
